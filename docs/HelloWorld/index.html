    <h1>Hello World Game</h1>
    <h2>Created by: Sage Walsh, Connor Goodman, Eric Trofimchik, and Mark Mavis</h2>
    
    <p>Humanity is on the brink of extinction due to climate change. In a last ditch effort,
         the remaining survivors of Earth travel through the cosmos, searching for a new world to colonize. 
         The transportation: A giant robot that hops between planets. Against incredibly dangerous odds, 
         will the humans be able to say “Hello” to a new world?

        <h3>Prototype 1:</h3>
        <a href = "https://sagewalsh.github.io/385Assignments/HelloWorld/Prototype1">WebGL Build</a>
        <p>A: counter-clockwise movement around planet</p>
        <p>D: clockwise movement around planet</p>
        <p>Space: jump / double jump</p>
        <p>15 planet run, with different gravity strengths and different sized planets.</p>
        <p>If the player double-jumps in the right place, they should be able to switch to the 
            other planet's gravitational sphere. Jumping indirectly into another planet's gravity
            can either cause a slingshot affect out of the gravity, or causes the player to circle
            the planet as they are lowered down into the surface.
        </p>
        <dt>Problems to address:</dt>
        <li>Future planets are often not visible</li>
        <li>Player tilts as they move</li>
        <li>Often jump out of gravity</li>
        <li>Player can slingshot off of multiple planets and skip most of the map</li>
        <li>No death</li>
        <li>No sun</li>
    
    
        <h3>Prototype 2:</h3>
        <a href = "https://sagewalsh.github.io/385Assignments/HelloWorld/Prototype2">WebGL Build</a>
        <p>Flying aliens are introduced into the world. They aren't affected by gravity. They follow
            player around. Multiple can collect and follow you at a time. They appear not to continue
            following you after you go to the next planet. 
        </p>
        <p>Lighting follows the player around the planet. Other planets are slightly lit so they
            remain visible from the planet you are currently on.
        </p>
        <dt>Problems to address:</dt>
        <li>Aliens can go through/behind planets</li>
        <li>Aliens don't kill the player</li>
        <li>Aliens don't die</li>
        <li>You can ride an alien out of the planets gravity</li>
        <li>Future planets are often not visible</li>
        <li>Player tilts as they move</li>
        <li>Often jump out of gravity</li>
        <li>Player can slingshot off of multiple planets and skip most of the map</li>
        <li>No death</li>
        <li>No sun</li>

        <h3>Prototype 3:</h3>
        <a href = https://sagewalsh.github.io/385Assignments/HelloWorld/Prototype3>WebGL Build</a>
        <dt>Prototype to start addressing the problems that arose in the first two prototypes.</dt>
        <li>End of Game Trigger</li>
        <li>Game Reset</li>
        <li>Player Death</li>
        <li>Player Bullets</li>
        <li>Ammo tracker + pickup</li>
        <li>Seeing nearby planets</li>
        <li>Oxygen bar</li>
        <li>Player UI</li>

        <h3>Prototype 4:</h3>
        <a href = https://sagewalsh.github.io/385Assignments/HelloWorld/Prototype4>WebGL Build</a>
        <dt>This prototype has added a few key elements</dt>
        <li>Coins</li>
        <li>Ammo</li>
        <li>Music</li>
        <li>Push force when shooting out of gravity</li>
        <li>An Earth texture for the final planet</li>
