    <h1>Hello World Game</h1>
    <h2>Created by: Sage Walsh, Connor Goodman, Eric Trofimchik, and Mark Mavis</h2>
    <p>Humanity is on the brink of extinction due to climate change. In a last ditch effort, the remaining survivors of Earth travel through the cosmos, searching for a new world to colonize. The transportation: A giant robot that hops between planets. Against incredibly dangerous odds, will the humans be able to say “Hello” to a new world?</p>
    <h3>Prototype 1:</h3>
    <a href = "https://sagewalsh.github.io/385Assignments/HelloWorld/Prototype1">WebGL Build</a>
    <p>A: counter-clockwise movement around planet</p>
    <p>D: clockwise movement around planet</p>
    <p>Space: jump / double jump</p>
    <p>If player gets enough momentum, it is possible to double jump off of the planet's
        gravitational force and fall downwards off the screen.
    </p>
    <p>If the player double-jumps in the right place, they should be able to switch to the 
        other planet's gravitational sphere. If they do it incorrectly they can hover
        between the two gravities. (When hovering just jump again to return to the planet
        in which you came).
    </p>
