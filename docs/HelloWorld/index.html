            <p>
                Hello World is a 2D platformer inspired by Super Mario Galaxy that 
                was released in 2007 for the Nintendo Wii. What made this game feel 
                and play unique would be the way the player wIn it, the player controls 
                a large robot continuing to the last city of humanity. The robot is 
                traveling through space, hopping between planets to find a new world to 
                settle. On the way, the robot must battle deadly aliens.

            <p>Humanity is on the brink of extinction due to climate change. In a last ditch effort,
                the remaining survivors of Earth travel through the cosmos, searching for a new world to colonize.

                    other planet's gravitational sphere. Jumping indirectly into another planet's gravity
                    can either cause a slingshot affect out of the gravity, or causes the player to circle
                    the planet as they are lowered down into the surface.

            <p>Reviewers: 12</p>

            <dt>The most common critiques were:</dt>
            <li>It is easy to die if an alien is right where you land</li>
            <li>Green orbs are not clearly ammo</li>
            <li>The ability to shoot through planets is not intuitive</li>
            <li>Checkpoints would be a great addition</li>
            <li>Shooting in zero gravity is not intuitive</li>
            <li>Bullets do not clearly damage the enemies</li>

            <li>Fixed the coin placement</li>
            <li>Added cracks in the enemy's sprite to indicate health</li>

            <h2>Session 2: Beta</h2>
            <p>Reviewers: 6</p>

            <dt>The most common critiques were:</dt>
            <li>The artwork is inconsistent</li>
            <li>The music is too loud</li>

            <h2>Session 3: Final Playtest</h2>
            <p>Reviewers: 10</p>

            <dt>The most common critiques were:</dt>
            <li>The player feels too slow</li>
            <li>The game could use a healing system</li>
            <li>It is frustrating when you hit aliens while jumping between planets</li>
            <li>The game could use an alien indicator</li>
            <li>Double jump timing is not intuitive</li>
            <li>More zero gravity sections would be fun</li>
            <li>Larger planets and smalelr planets are not as fun as the medium ones</li>
            <li>Aliens could be more difficult</li>
            <li>Muted audio resets after player death</li>
            <li>The shooting sound is too loud</li>
            <li>The level is too long</li>
            <li>The game is only one level</li>

            <p>The first change in the final build of the game will be to address audio 
                bugs. The second change will be increasing the player speed slightly. 
                We have a lot of feedback saying the player should be faster. However, 
                if they are too fast some of the game physics do not work as well. A 
                third change in the final build of the game will be a healing system. 
                Coins will slightly heal the player, making the game more forgiving and 
                giving another reason to collect coins.
            </p>
            <p>The first future change we would like to extend the game with is more alien 
                types. More aliens types, such as walking aliens and shooting aliens, 
                would add more challenge and depth to the game. A second change we would 
                like to make is redesigning the double jump. The current double jump is 
                not intuitive to the player in how jump height works. Instead of activating 
                the second jump at the apex of the first jump, the player must press jump 
                for the second time immediately after the first. We would like to rework 
                it so that the second jump must be timed with the apex of the first. A 
                third change we would like to make is breaking up the game into multiple, 
                shortwer levels. This way the player can save their progress more easily 
                and lose less progress when they die. This would also make the game longer.

            <p>
                One thing our team did very well was communicate clearly and consistently with each other. 
                We always kept each other informed on who was doing what and when. To shop for this, we 
                have a highly active discord. Another thing we did well was grant each other high levels 
                of creative freedom. Whoever was inspired to do something in the game was highly encouraged 
                to chase after that inspiration. To show for this, we have highly unique planets, music, 
                player art, and level design. A third thing we did really well was adapt the game to 
                challenging situations. We originally intended for the player to get sucked into the sun if 
                out of a planet’s gravity. However, this proved to be clunky, buggy, and not fun. We swapped 
                this feature out at a moment’s notice with an oxygen bar system that kills the player if they 
                leave gravity.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we had a few more weeks for the game, the first priority would be to add health pickups. 
                Currently, there is no way for the player to heal. This can be frustrating and difficult. 
                Health pickups would address this. The second priority would be to add more levels. Our game 
                is currently one long level. We would like to swap this with several slightly shorter levels. 
                A third priority item would be to add new alien types. Currently, there is one alien type. The
                game would be deeper and more complex with more aliens that could be/ attack in different ways.
