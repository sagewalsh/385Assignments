                We created a game called Hello World!
            </h2>
            <!-- Description of the Game and How to Play -->
            <p>
                Hello World is a 2D platformer inspired by Super Mario Galaxy that was released in 
                2007 for the Nintendo Wii. A little background on the staff that worked on the game, 
                Sage had worked on a text-based dungeon-adventure game, Connor had worked on a computer 
                card game that had players battling vampires, and Eric had worked on a dungeon side-scroller. 
                What made this game feel and play unique would be the way the player moved around with 
                different kinds of planets with their own kind of gravity. The game also features tons 
                of custom artwork with a unique pixel art style. Major features that the game offers 
                is allowing the player to jump between planets and having a hidden path that the player 
                could find, giving them a sense of exploration and challenge. The story revolves around 
                the player controlling a large robot continuing to the last city of humanity. The robot 
                is traveling through space, hopping between planets to find a new world to settle. On the 
                way, the robot must battle deadly aliens. The is set to release for PC on June 10th, 2021, 
                with a player rating of T for teen. With a final demo score of 4.4 out of 5.

                <h3>What didn't work throughout the prototypes:</h3>
                <p>We realized early on in the game development that if the player moved too quickly then
                    they would start to hover off the of the planets surface. This combined with a lower 
                    gravity made it so you could jump while running to build momentum and launch out of
                    the atmosphere entirely. We similarly had trouble finding a good jumping power for the
                    player. Too strong and it was hard to create a gravity to keep them down, too weak and
                    you couldn't escape to the next planet. With this in mind, we kept the player's motion
                    at a constant slower, weaker speed and decided to play with the planet's gravity. 
                    When messing with the gravity the biggest thing we had to focus on was making sure the
                    bounds of the atmosphere matched the strength of the gravity. If the gravity was strong
                    it meant that the player's jump power wouldn't get them very far so we had to make the
                    atmosphere range smaller. If the gravity was weak it meant the player could get far 
                    away from the surface so the atmosphere range had to be large.
                </p>
                <p>A problem we struggled with early on was the player's ability to sling-shot off of planets
                    by building momentum and gliding through the edges of different atmospheres. One of the 
                    main reasons this was happening was because of our attempt to give the player its own 
                    gravity. We wanted the player to escape a planets atmosphere and start falling downwards.
                    Eventually we were going to create a sun like object that the player would fall into and 
                    die. But this additional gravity on the player caused a lot of problems with the mechanics
                    and made the player a lot harder to control when jumping between planets. Eventually we 
                    scrapped the idea and implemented a push force when you shoot in the absense of atmosphere.

            <h2>Session 2: Beta</h2>
            <p>Reviewers: 6</p>

            <dt>The most common critiques were:</dt>
            <li>The artwork is inconsistent</li>
            <li>The music is too loud</li>

            <h2>Session 3: Final Playtest</h2>
            <p>Reviewers: 10</p>

            <dt>The most common critiques were:</dt>
            <li>The player feels too slow</li>
            <li>The game could use a healing system</li>
            <li>It is frustrating when you hit aliens while jumping between planets</li>
            <li>The game could use an alien indicator</li>
            <li>Double jump timing is not intuitive</li>
            <li>More zero gravity sections would be fun</li>
            <li>Larger planets and smalelr planets are not as fun as the medium ones</li>
            <li>Aliens could be more difficult</li>
            <li>Muted audio resets after player death</li>
            <li>The shooting sound is too loud</li>
            <li>The level is too long</li>
            <li>The game is only one level</li>

            <p>The first change in the final build of the game will be to address audio 
                bugs. The second change will be increasing the player speed slightly. 
                We have a lot of feedback saying the player should be faster. However, 
                if they are too fast some of the game physics do not work as well. A 
                third change in the final build of the game will be a healing system. 
                Coins will slightly heal the player, making the game more forgiving and 
                giving another reason to collect coins.
            </p>
            <p>The first future change we would like to extend the game with is more alien 
                types. More aliens types, such as walking aliens and shooting aliens, 
                would add more challenge and depth to the game. A second change we would 
                like to make is redesigning the double jump. The current double jump is 
                not intuitive to the player in how jump height works. Instead of activating 
                the second jump at the apex of the first jump, the player must press jump 
                for the second time immediately after the first. We would like to rework 
                it so that the second jump must be timed with the apex of the first. A 
                third change we would like to make is breaking up the game into multiple, 
                shortwer levels. This way the player can save their progress more easily 
                and lose less progress when they die. This would also make the game longer.

            <h3>Special thanks to Anthony Valentine for making the music!</h3>

            <h3>Team Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                One thing our team did very well was communicate clearly and consistently with each other. 
                We always kept each other informed on who was doing what and when. To shop for this, we 
                have a highly active discord. Another thing we did well was grant each other high levels 
                of creative freedom. Whoever was inspired to do something in the game was highly encouraged 
                to chase after that inspiration. To show for this, we have highly unique planets, music, 
                player art, and level design. A third thing we did really well was adapt the game to 
                challenging situations. We originally intended for the player to get sucked into the sun if 
                out of a planet’s gravity. However, this proved to be clunky, buggy, and not fun. We swapped 
                this feature out at a moment’s notice with an oxygen bar system that kills the player if they 
                leave gravity.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we had a few more weeks for the game, the first priority would be to add health pickups. 
                Currently, there is no way for the player to heal. This can be frustrating and difficult. 
                Health pickups would address this. The second priority would be to add more levels. Our game 
                is currently one long level. We would like to swap this with several slightly shorter levels. 
                A third priority item would be to add new alien types. Currently, there is one alien type. The
                game would be deeper and more complex with more aliens that could be/ attack in different ways.
